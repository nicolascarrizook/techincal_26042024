# SpaceX Launch Tracker

This project is a ReactJS application using Vite that displays a list of SpaceX launches. It integrates Apollo Client for data fetching from a GraphQL API and includes features like infinite scrolling and responsive design. The aim is to provide a seamless experience in browsing SpaceX launches, displaying essential data such as the launch ID, mission name, rocket name, and launch site.

## Features

- **ReactJS with Vite:** Utilizes the fast and modern build tool Vite for React applications.
- **Apollo Client:** Manages data fetching, caching, and state management of GraphQL data.
- **Responsive UI:** Adapts to various screen sizes using either a table or card layout.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Continuously loads data as the user scrolls down, enhancing user experience.
- **Testing:** Includes tests that ensure the GraphQL API responses are cached and data is rendered correctly.
